How to Build a CLI Gem 

1. Plan your gem, imagine your interface 
2. Start with the project structure - google 
3. Start with the entry point - the file run 
4. Force that to build the CLI interface 
5. Stub out the interface 
6. Start making things real (Ex. real objects instead of strings)
7. Discover objects (scrape (?))
8. Program 


- A command line interface for climbs at LRC 

User types climbing_cli (?)) [Should this be something more specific or directed? "Take me Climbing" or simply "Climb"? "Climb-Time"?]

Shows list of problems at LRC 
  1. Art of the Vogi - V4 - description - star rating 
  2. Sternum - V5 - description - star rating 
  3. A Face in the Crowd - V7 - description - star rating 
  etc.

Which climb do you want to learn more about?
  Populates further info on that specific climb. (Pics, comments, safety rating, video link if on Mtn Project.)
  
Think about this. How can it best serve user? And should it be super different from Mtn Projec or is it okay if there is commonalities? (IE - on Mtn Project, the person can search for a climb via grade.)

Other components you can weave in:
  Short climber vs. tall climber 
  Scary/dangerous vs. not 
  Climbs based on grade as a starting point and narrow from there
  Climbs based on star-rating
